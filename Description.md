## 🧊 Data Cube Model for OLAP Operations

This project implements a **Data Cube model** used in **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** systems for multidimensional data analysis. The main objective is to demonstrate how a cube-based data structure enables **efficient aggregation, slicing, dicing, and drill-down operations** across various dimensions — typically used in business intelligence, decision support systems, and data warehousing.

### 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Objective**: Create a 3D Data Cube using a sample sales dataset and apply OLAP operations such as **roll-up, drill-down, slice, dice, and pivot**.
- **Use Case**: Analyzing sales data based on **Product**, **Region**, and **Time** dimensions.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Language: Python
  - Environment: Jupyter Notebook
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### 🧠 Implementation Overview

#### 1. **Dataset Preparation**
- Created or imported a sample dataset containing:
  - `Product`, `Region`, `Time`, `Sales`
- Ensured data cleanliness and consistency.

#### 2. **Data Cube Creation**
- Used `pandas` multi-indexing and pivot tables to simulate a **3D cube structure**.
- Each axis (dimension) corresponds to one of: Product, Region, Time.

#### 3. **OLAP Operations Implemented**
- ✅ **Roll-Up**: Aggregation from lower to higher levels (e.g., months to quarters).
- ✅ **Drill-Down**: Breaking down data from higher granularity to more detail.
- ✅ **Slice**: Fixing a value for one dimension to extract a 2D subset.
- ✅ **Dice**: Selecting a sub-cube by specifying values for two or more dimensions.
- ✅ **Pivoting**: Rearranging data to visualize different perspectives.

#### 4. **Visualization**
- Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for:
  - Heatmaps
  - Bar plots
  - Cube slices
  - Pivot summaries

### 📊 Results & Insights

- Generated interactive summaries for multiple business scenarios.
- Helped understand how multidimensional queries can be performed efficiently.
- Demonstrated OLAP’s power in visualizing trends across dimensions.

### 📌 Future Extensions

- Add time hierarchies (day → week → month → quarter → year)
- Use real-world datasets (e.g. Superstore, Retail, etc.)
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash
- Implement optimization techniques for large-scale cubes
